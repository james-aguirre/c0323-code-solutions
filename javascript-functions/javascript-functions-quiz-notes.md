## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
A block of re usable code that's not performed until called upon
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
The function keyword, name(optional), parameter, code block and return statement(optional)
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
The function name plus whichever arguments being called in parenthesis
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
A function definition has the entire code block to run and a function call just has the function name + whichever arguments it's being called with
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
A parameter is used to define a function and acts as a placeholder, an argument is used when calling a function
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
They are able to be switched out with different arguments making the function more dynamic
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
It causes the function to produce a value we can use and it ends the functions code block at the same time.
